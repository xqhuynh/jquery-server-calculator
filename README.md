# jQUERY SERVER SIDE CALCULATOR

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Assignment

A simple calculator where the user can input two values and select a math operator. When the (= button) is clicked, it displays the answer. A history of the answer will append to the DOM after each mathematical expression is submitted using the (= button). 

To input a new math problem, the user will click the (C button) to clear the previous inputs. A history of the math problems will exist even after refreshing the page but will clear once the server restarts.
